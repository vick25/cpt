Web mapping application for tracking development projects in nairobi county, kenya.
Application developed as part of my final year project for the award of a degree in b.sc geospatial engineering.
This application relied on projects data stored in postgres+postgis database and served through geoserver 2.8.1 using views.
Bitnami Wamp Stack 5.5.31-0 was used as a local web server.
